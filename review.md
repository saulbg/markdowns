# Excercise 22: Glossary
## Python 3

### Arithmetic Operators

+ `+`: Addition
+ `-`: Subtraction.
+ `*`: Multiplication.
+ `/`: Division.
+ `%`: The modulus returns the remainder of the division.
+ `**`: Exponentiation.
+ `//`: Integer division rounds down for both positive and negative numbers.

### Boolean Operators

+ `and`: True if both values are true
+ `or`: True if at least one value is true.
+ `not`: True only if false.
+ `bool()`: Allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return.

### Strings


+ `def()`: defines a function
+ `len()`: to get the length of a string.
+ `return()`: returns a value from a function
+ `lower()`: returns the string in lower case
+ `upper()`: returns the string in upper case.
+ `replace()`: replaces a string with another string.
+ `split()`: it splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator.

### Variables

+ `print()`: prints out a newline at the end.
+ `input()`: returns the data as a string.
+ `range()`: uses the generator to produce numbers within a range.
+ `enumerate()`: adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerate object.
+ `open()`: to open certain file.
+ `[]`: returns the character at the given index.
+ `in`: Returns true if a character exists in the given string.
+ `as`: is used to create an alias.
+ `import`: used to import modules.
+ `from`: used to import only a specified section from a module.
+ `list = []`: It creates an object list
+ `.append()`: add the value to the end of a list.
+ `.pop()`: remove the value from the end fo a list.
+ `.count()`: count the elements of a list.
+ `.reverse()`: reverse the elements order of a list.
+ `.sort()`: sort the elements by alphabetical order in the list.
+ `list[]` : access a list like you would any array.
+ `.remove()`: remove first occurrence of a value.
+ `tup()`: converts a list or string to a tuple object.
+ `dict = {}`: dictionaries store mappings from keys to values.

###  Control flow and iterables

+ `if`: to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not.
+ `else`: optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following if.
+ `for`: iterate over lists.
+ `while`: go until a condition is no longer met.


## C 

### Characters
+ `Letters Aa-Zz`: They are the ones that help us to go from an unwritten language to one that is. They are used at all time throughout the codes since they're the instruments with which we write.
+ `Numbers 0-9`: They are assigned numerical values, they can be used to count, be constant, as conditionals, etc.
+ `()`: They are used in functions, loops, conditionals and are part of the delimitation of values or conditionals, they are part of the syntax in many structures.
+ `[]`: They are used to declare arrays and are placed just after the variable name, inside is the size that you want to assign.
+ `{}`: Usually used to mark the start and ending of a function, structure or cycle.
+ `;`: They are always used at the end of some line of code where a variable or process is declared, called or used.
+ `*`: Mainly used to declare or distinguish a pointer. But it is also the perator belonging to a multiplication.
+ `#`: Used to import and call the libraries.
+ `/n`: Characters that together belong to a new line.
+ `/t`: Characters that together belong to a tab.
+ `"` : These are part of the syntaxis of some funcions such as printf of scanf when we specifically want to show, read or write something.

### Operators
+ `+` :Operator belonging to a sum.
+ `-`: Operator belonging to a subtraction.
+ `**`: Operator belonging to a exponentiation.
+ `%`: Operator belonging to the modulus that returns the remainder when the dividend is divided by the divisor.
+ `< or >` : Logical operator belonging to greater than or less than.
+ `|` : Logical operator belonging to a disjunction.
+ `&` : Logical operator belonging to a conjunction, it is also used in pointers to turn a value into a pointer.
+ `=` : It is used when we assign or compare the a value.
+ `!` : Usually goes next to = and it used in conditionals to compare the value of two variables and say is they're different.

### Libraries
+ `include directive`: Tells the preprocessor to insert the contents of another file into the source code at the point where the #include directive is found.
+ `Stdio.h`: Provides the core input and output capabilities of the C language. This file includes the venerable printf function.
+ `stdlib.h`: Library for General Utility Functions.
+ `String.h`:	Library for String Functions.

### Variable Types
+ `int`: For integers.
+ `float`: For Floats.
+ `char`: For characters.
+ `FILE`: For handling files. Contains all the information necessary to control the stream.
+ `argc` : The name of the variable argc stands for "argument count"; argc contains the number of arguments passed to the program. 
+ `argv` : The name of the variable argv stands for "argument vector". A vector is a one-dimensional array, and argv is a one-dimensional array of strings.

### Functions
+ `printf()`: Refers to a control parameter used by a class of functions in the input/output libraries
+ `scanf()`: It is a control parameter used in various functions to specify the layout of an input string.
+ `Void()`: The void keyword meaning nothing or no value.
+ `Return()`: The return keyword terminates the function and returns the value.
+ `fopen()`: Function to create a new file or to open an existing file.
+ `fclose()`: Function to close the file.
+ `sizeof()`: The sizeof keyword evaluates the size of data (a variable or a constant).
+ `break`: Used with any loop OR switch case.
+ `struct`: It is used for declaring a structure. A structure can hold variables of different types under a single name.
+ `EOF`: indicates de End Of File.

### Loops
+ `if and else`: if and else are used to make decisions.
+ `for`: A type of loop.
+ `While`: Evaluates the test expression inside the parenthesis. If the test expression is true, statements inside the body of while loop are executed. Then, the test expression is evaluated again.
+ `do...while` : It is similar to the while loop with one important difference. The body of do...while loop is executed at least once. Only then, the test expression is evaluated.
+ `switch and case` : The switch and case statement is used when a block of statements has to be executed among many blocks.
