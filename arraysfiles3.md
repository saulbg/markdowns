# Classification of arrays 

## One-dimensional arrays  
An array is a variable that can store multiple values, as its name say an one-dimensional array it means that has just one array of n numbers. Supose that you want to store 100 integers, the way that you can create an array for it, will be:
A particular position is associated with each element of the array, to access these elements it is necessary to use an index.
```c  
int data[100];
```  
A particular position is associated with each element of the array, to access these elements it is necessary to use an index.  
To make clear the declaration of the array you can see the next example.
```c 
typeofdata nameofarray[sizeofarray];  
```  

### Mutidimensional arrays  
The syntaxis for multidimensional arrays is the next.
```c  
typofdata nameofarray[size][size]...[size];
```  
Where name refers to the identifier of the array, size is an integer number and define the maximun number of elements that the array can contain.  
The data types that a multidimensional array can support are: integer, real, character or structure.  
This is an example using multidimensional arrays.
```c  
#include<stdio.h>  
int main(){
int matrix[3][3]={{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};
int i, j;
printf("Print matrix\n);
for (i=0; i<3; i++){
	printf("%d, ", matrix[i][j]);
	}
 	printf("\n";
}
return 42;
}
````  
  
## Organization and Management of Files  

# Dataflow  
A data flow diagram plots the flow of information for any process or system. It uses defined symbols, such as rectangles, circles, and arrows, in addition to short text labels, to display data inputs and outputs, storage points, and routes between each destination.  
They can be used to analyze an existing system or to model a new one. Similar to all the best diagrams and charts, a DFD can often visually "say" things that would be difficult to explain in words and work for both technical and non-technical audiences, from developers to managers.  

# Text Files
Text files are the normal .txt files. You can easily create text files using any simple text editors such as Notepad.  
When you open those files, you'll see all the contents within the file as plain text. You can easily edit or delete the contents.  
They take minimum effort to maintain, are easily readable, and provide the least security and takes bigger storage space.  
To start working with files you need to declare a pointer of type file.  
```c
FILE *fptr;
```  
To open it you must use:  
```c 
ptr= fopen("fileopen","mode");
```  
For example: _fopen("E:\\cprogram\\newprogram.txt","w");_  
There are many ways to work with files, you can read, write, open for append, etc.  

# Binary files  
Binary files are mostly the .bin files in your computer.  
Instead of storing data in plain text, they store it in the binary form (0's and 1's).  
They can hold a higher amount of data, are not readable easily, and provides better.  
To write into a binary file, you need to use the fwrite() function. The functions take four arguments:  
+ address of data to be written in the disk
+ size of data to be written in the disk
+ number of such type of data
+ pointer to the file where you want to write.  
```c 
fwrite(addressData, sizeData, numbersData, pointerToFile);  
```  
For example:  
```c  
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct threeNum
{
   int n1, n2, n3;
};

int main()
{
   int n;
   struct threeNum num;
   FILE *fptr;

   if ((fptr = fopen("C:\\program.bin","wb")) == NULL){
       printf("Error! opening file");

       // Program exits if the file pointer returns NULL.
       exit(1);
   }

   for(n = 1; n < 5; ++n)
   {
      num.n1 = n;
      num.n2 = 5*n;
      num.n3 = 5*n + 1;
      fwrite(&num, sizeof(struct threeNum), 1, fptr); 
   }
   fclose(fptr); 
```  

# Managements of files  

## Opening files  
You can use the fopen( ) function to create a new file or to open an existing file. This call will initialize an object of the type FILE, which contains all the information necessary to control the stream. The prototype of this function call is as follows:    
```c
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char * mode);
```
These are the modes that you can manage the files:  
+ _r_ : Opens an existing text file for reading purpose.  
+ _w_ : Opens a text file for writing. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start writing content from the beginning of the file.  
+ _a_ : Opens a text file for writing in appending mode. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start appending content in the existing file content.  
+ _r+_ : Opens a text file for both reading and writing.  
+ _w+_ : Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist.  
+ _a+_ : Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It creates the file if it does not exist. The reading will start from the beginning but writing can only be appended.  

## Closing files  
To close a file, use the fclose( ) function. The prototype of this function is:  
```c  
int fclose( FILE *fp);  
```
The fclose(-) function returns zero on success, or EOF if there is an error in closing the file. This function actually flushes any data still pending in the buffer to the file, closes the file, and releases any memory used for the file. The EOF is a constant defined in the header file stdio.h.  
There are various functions provided by C standard library to read and write a file, character by character, or in the form of a fixed length string.  

## Writing files  
Following is the simplest function to write individual characters to a stream:  
```c  
int fputc(int c, FILE *fp);  
The function fputc() writes the character value of the argument c to the output stream referenced by fp. It returns the written character written on success otherwise EOF if there is an error.  

## Reading files  
Given below is the simplest function to read a single character from a file:  
```c  
int fgetc( FILE * fp);  
The fgetc() function reads a character from the input file referenced by fp. The return value is the character read, or in case of any error, it returns EOF.  
The functions fgets() reads up to n-1 characters from the input stream referenced by fp. It copies the read string into the buffer buf, appending a null character to terminate the string.
